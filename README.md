# Heavenly Conics

An interactive 3D visualization tool exploring the relationship between planetary orbits and conic sections. Users can manipulate a planet's initial velocity to observe how its trajectory around a sun intersects with a dynamic cone, revealing various conic shapes. This engaging web-based application, built with Three.js, offers an intuitive way to understand celestial mechanics and geometric principles, bridging the gap between astronomy and mathematics.
